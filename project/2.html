    <pre>Game Homepage</pre>
    <p>The main purpose of the application is to allow the audience to test their knowledge on information of Facebook friends in a simple gameplay format. The application offers an alternative way for Facebook users to learn about their friends in the social network site in a gamification environment rather than the normal profile browsing activity. We would like to enable the audience to discover more about their friends and have fun in a quiz gameplay environment. We have implemented the scoring and ranking system as part of the gamification elements in order to add motivation for users to continue using the application.</p>
