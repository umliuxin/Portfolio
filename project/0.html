    <p>Pregnancy is a complicated and special process with many bodily changes, discomforts, and possibilities of complications. Partners of expectant mothers share a close relationship and often play an important role during pregnancy. In order to map the existing gap, my teammates and I decided to design a solution based on the solid research and our UX knowledge.</p>
    <p>During investigative research, we assessed the expectant parents’ needs by conducting interviews and surveys. By convenient access, we interviewed six (expectant) mothers and four (expectant) partners about their pregnancy-related experiences. We also conducted online surveys which recieved over 140 response to study how expectant mothers and their partners consider pregnancy.</p>

    <pre>During Interview</pre>
    <p>In the design process, we created four personas including two expectant mothers and two for expectant partners. These personas helped us capture the behaviors and needs of users as well as the characteristics of the information seeking behavior of an expectant couple and the communication between them</p>

    <p>To solve the problems above, we proposed Nuwa, which is a mobile system consisting of a sensing wristband to collect maternal health measurements and a mobile application for both the mother and her partner. The system aims at utilizing the mother’s body data, to raise the couple’s awareness on the maternal health, and facilitate the partner’s support in the overall process. In the end, our system can enhance the couple experience during the pregnancy. Through iteration including wireframe, low-fi protoype, mid prototype, usability testing and heuristic evaluation, we converted our ideas to real products.</p>
