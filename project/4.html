    <p>During Designing, My teammates and I focused on how to keep our content attractive to public. In order to understand what content is most useful and valuable to users, we did a comparative analysis to compare our strength and weakness between other similar websites. Also we considered different user group and how they access to the content like tools or reports.</p>

    <p>In the development process, my main task is to keep all pages responsive on different width of screens. In order to implement this, I used drupal themes to set up css media query. Meanwhile, all content is wraped and controlled by blocks, views, modules and pages. Some images and buttons were optimized for different user experience, such as touch screen. </p>
