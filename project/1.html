	<p>The visualization helps potential users analyze the characteristics of Oscar movies from past nominees and winners and predict the future potential nominees or winners. The system also helps analyze the relation between budget and gross, rating and votes in each (genre) of movies, and predicting the trends of these characteristics.</p>

	<p>The visualization includes three main views in order to compare different variables acrossing movies, genres, and decades. An animated bubble chart shows all Oscar best picture movies to see the quantity and gross of each genre. An interactive scatterplot shows the relation among gross, budget and rating for all winners and nominees. A multi-series line chart shows the comparison of all movies or winners/nominees by the five variables.</p>

	<p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="http://delay.liu-xin.com/" role="button" target="_blank">Open Live Demo</a></p>
	<p>The visualization is about the flight delay statistic in 17 main airports in the United  States in 2013. The question I am trying to answer is that when people departing from  one city, which destination cities or which carriers have less delay or cancellation. The information helps people make decision of choosing travel destination and airlines. </p>

	<pre>Gross Comparison between movies</pre>
	<p>In order to present the flight delay condition all over the United States thoroughly, the tool should show departure and arrival delay condition in one city, departure and arrival delay condition of one specific flight, departure and arrival delay condition between two specific cities, comparison between cities, flights, carriers or the other categories, time series of departure and arrival delay condition, and the reason of delay.</p>
